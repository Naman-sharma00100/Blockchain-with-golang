# Blockchain-with-golang

This is a project in which a simple version fo blockchain had been implemented using Golang. For simplicity the entire code has been written in Golang only without the use of any other tech stacks.

You can implement this in your local by simply cloning the repository and using the command in the terminal:

#Go run main.go

Postman APIs for this project can be found here, in case you want to test it.
